cpp
vector<int> adjLis[V];  // 0-based indexing


And wondering why this works in many places like LeetCode or VS Code, but some environments (like certain compilers or interview platforms) warn or crash.

Let me walk you through why it works sometimes, why it‚Äôs risky, and the proper alternative.

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer

> vector<int> adjLis[V]; works only when V is a compile-time constant, or if the compiler allows Variable Length Arrays (VLAs) ‚Äî which are not standard C++.

---

## ‚ùå Why It‚Äôs Problematic

cpp
vector<int> adjLis[V];


This creates a stack-allocated array of vectors, of size V.

### But C++ (according to the standard):

 Does not support VLAs (arrays whose size is determined at runtime).
 This is a GCC / Clang extension, not part of ISO C++.

That‚Äôs why:

 ‚úÖ It compiles and runs in GCC/Clang (e.g., LeetCode, some online judges, VS Code with g++).
 ‚ö†Ô∏è It fails or gives warnings in stricter compilers (e.g., MSVC or -pedantic mode).
 ‚ùå It may crash with large V, because the array is on the stack, not heap.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Standard C++ Way (Always Safe):

cpp
vector<vector<int>> adjLis(V);  // heap-allocated, dynamically sized


 This uses the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
 Works everywhere ‚Äî LeetCode, MSVC, Clang, GCC, interviews, etc.
 Avoids crashing due to stack overflow for large V.

---

## üß™ Example (What You‚Äôre Doing)

cpp
int V;
cin >> V;
vector<int> adjLis[V];  // ‚ùå Not standard-compliant


 If V = 100000, you‚Äôre allocating 100,000 vector<int>s on the stack ‚Äî very risky.

---

## ‚úÖ Safer Equivalent:

cpp
int V;
cin >> V;
vector<vector<int>> adjLis(V);  // ‚úÖ Safe, portable, heap-allocated


---

## üß† When Your Code Works Anyway (Why It "Seems Fine")

| Platform                                 | Allows VLAs? | Behavior of vector<int> adjLis[V] |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| LeetCode                                 | Yes (GCC)    | Works fine                          |
| VS Code (g++)                            | Yes          | Works fine                          |
| MSVC / Interview IDEs                    | No           | Compilation error or warning        |
| Competitive Platforms (Codeforces, etc.) | Depends      | May work, may crash if V is large |

---

## üîö Summary

| Bad Practice                     | Good Practice                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| vector<int> adjLis[V];         | vector<vector<int>> adjLis(V); |
| Stack allocation of unknown size | Use heap allocation via vector |
| Non-standard (compiler-specific) | Standard C++ (portable & safe)   |

---

‚úÖ So yes, it works in many cases ‚Äî but that doesn't mean it's correct C++ or portable.
You‚Äôll be safer, cleaner, and interview-ready using vector<vector<int>> adj(V);.










That‚Äôs a very common confusion, and you're absolutely not alone in this ‚Äî many people mix up adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, especially in C++ because of how both can look similar in function signatures.

Let me give you a simple, reliable way to distinguish between them, especially in problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, interview platforms, etc.

---

## üß† 1. Understand the Type Signatures

### üî∏ Adjacency Matrix

Looks like a 2D grid:

cpp
vector<vector<int>> graph;


Each graph[i][j] is:

 1 if there is an edge between i and j
 0 if not

Example Input:

cpp
graph = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0]
];


 3 nodes
 Node 0 connected to 1, node 1 connected to 0 and 2, etc.

---

### üîπ Adjacency List

Each graph[i] contains a list of neighbors of node i:

cpp
vector<vector<int>> graph;


Each graph[i] is a vector of integers (neighbors)

Example Input:

cpp
graph = [
  [1],      // node 0 is connected to 1
  [0, 2],   // node 1 connected to 0 and 2
  [1]       // node 2 connected to 1
];


NOTE: Looks very similar in type (vector<vector<int>>) but represents completely different data.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. How to Know What You're Given

### üîç On LeetCode / Platforms: Look at the Description

Most problems explicitly tell you:

 "You are given an adjacency list" ‚ûú It's a list.
 "You are given an adjacency matrix" ‚ûú It's a matrix.

If not clear, look at the example input:

### Example:

cpp
graph = [
  [2,4,6],        // node 1 is connected to nodes 2,4,6
  [1,4,8,9],      // node 2 is connected to 1,4,8,9
  ...
]


This is clearly an adjacency list. Why?

 The subarrays are not all the same size (matrix would be square)
 Each subarray contains node numbers ‚Üí neighbors

---

## üß™ 3. Quick Visual Rule of Thumb:

| Trait                | Adjacency Matrix        | Adjacency List            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Type                 | vector<vector<int>>   | vector<vector<int>>     |
| Subarray size        | All same (n x n)        | Varies (based on degrees) |
| Values inside        | 0/1                     | Neighbor node numbers     |
| graph[i][j] means? | 1 if edge between i & j | j-th neighbor of i        |
| Platform phrasing    | "adjacency matrix"      | "adjacency list"          |

---

## üëÄ 4. What About vector<int> adj[]?

That‚Äôs just another way of writing an adjacency list ‚Äî typically used when:

 You know the number of vertices at compile-time (or use int V)
 It's a common format in competitive programming

Example:

cpp
int V = 5;
vector<int> adj[V];  // adj list for 5 vertices


This is functionally the same as:

cpp
vector<vector<int>> adj(V);


The only difference is syntax and memory layout, but both are adjacency lists.

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äì How to Identify Adjacency List vs Matrix

| Input Looks Like                               | Type             | What to do                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Square n x n grid with 0/1                   | Adjacency matrix | Convert to list if needed |
| Jagged list of neighbors                       | Adjacency list   | Use directly              |
| Declared as vector<int> adj[] or adjList[] | Adjacency list   | Use directly              |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Tip

When in doubt, just print:

cpp
for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
    cout << "Node " << i << ": ";
    for (int j = 0; j < graph[i].size(); j++) {
        cout << graph[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}


If each line shows a list of neighbors ‚Üí adjacency list.
If it shows 0/1 for all columns ‚Üí adjacency matrix.

Let me know if you'd like a utility function to convert between them, or practice with some examples!
